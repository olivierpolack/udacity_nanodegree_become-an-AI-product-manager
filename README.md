# Udacity_Nanodegree_program_Become an AI product manager

I am curious about how AI works, not only how internally all the neurons inside process and "choose" the answers, but also what is required to actually benefit from AI. Any tool is useful but only if you know how to use it.

I managed to know much more about what it takes to manage AI product thanks to this Udacity nanodegree course and I am pleased to share that with you. 
After designing a data labeling job and training a machine learning model with Google ML in the first two projects, I chose to develop a business proposal 
Data annotation project - the first of the three projects of the Udacity "Become an AI product manager"

The project goal achieved here is to describe how annotators should work on images to classify them. Machine learning involves the creation of properly classified or annotated data,. This can be done by human annotators but they need to be well taught and guided.

Intelligence does not exist if learning is based on erroneous data.
