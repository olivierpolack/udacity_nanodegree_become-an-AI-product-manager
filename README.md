# Udacity_Nanodegree_program_Become an AI product manager

Thanks to the Udacity nanodegree course "Become an AI product manager", I understand more about what it takes to build an AI product. 
After designing a data labeling job and training a machine learning model with Google ML, the third project was to develop my own business proposal for an AI product of my choice. Not surprisingly I applied what I had learnt through the courses and my own research to design a business AI proposal giving valuable feedbacks from recorded phone calls in regards to customer satisfaction. I was astonished by the number of already available annotated voice recordings data bases, plus the diverse methodologies used in the field of speech emotion recognition systems. I am grateful to those who shared their work and helped me in the process, so I am setting up my own repository in Github about my work.

First Project - Image classification job
The first of the three projects of the Udacity "Become an AI product manager"

The project goals achieved are is to describe how annotators should work to classify medical images. Machine learning requires properly annotated data. Data annotation can be done by humans, but they need to be well taught and guided too.

Second Project - Model Building with Google ML
The second of three project is about training a model with different datasets and comparing the performances of the trained models.

--The expected conclusion of the first two projects: Intelligence does not exist if learning is based on erroneous data.

Third Projet - AI product proposal (ie "Capstone" project)
The "project 3 of 3" folder contains my work. The problem my proposed product is trying to solve is getting valuable feedbacks from recorded customer phone calls in regards to customer satisfaction.
