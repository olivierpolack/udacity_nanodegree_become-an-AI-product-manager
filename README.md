# Udacity_Nanodegree_program_Become an AI product manager

I am curious about how AI works, not only how internally all these "neurons" process and choose, but also what does it take to actually benefit from AI. Any tool is useful, if you know how to use it.

Thanks to this Udacity nanodegree course I took, I now understand much more about what it takes to manage AI product, I am pleased to share that with you. 
After designing a data labeling job and training a machine learning model with Google ML in the first two projects, the third project was to develop my own business proposal for an AI product of my choice. Not surprisingly I applied what I had learnt through the courses and my own research to design a business AI proposal giving valuable feedbacks from recorded phone calls in regards to customer satisfaction. I was astonished by the number of already available annotated voice recordings data bases, plus the diverse methodologies used in the field of speech emotion recognition systems. I am grateful to those who shared their work and helped me in the process, so I am setting up my own repository in Github about my work.

First Projet - Data annotation project
The first of the three projects of the Udacity "Become an AI product manager"

The project goals achieved are is to describe how annotators should work on images to classify them. Machine learning involves the creation of properly classified or annotated data,. This can be done by human annotators but they need to be well taught and guided.

Second Project - 
Intelligence does not exist if learning is based on erroneous data.
