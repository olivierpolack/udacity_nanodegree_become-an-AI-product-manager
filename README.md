# Udacity_Nanodegree_program_Become an AI product manager
Data annotation project - the first of the three projects of the Udacity "Become an AI product manager"

The project goal achieved here is to describe how annotators should work on images to classify them. Machine learning involves the creation of properly classified or annotated data,. This can be done by human annotators but they need to be well taught and guided.

Intelligence does not exist if learning is based on erroneous data.
